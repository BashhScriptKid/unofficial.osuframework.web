osu!framework is a framework with rhythm games such as [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) in mind.

This framework is intended to take steps beyond what you would normally expect from a game framework. This means things like basic UI elements, text rendering, advanced input handling (textboxes) and performance overlays are provided out-of-the-box!

There are multiple projects that have used osu!framework:

- [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu) â€“ rhythm is just a *click* away! (obviously)

- [GDEdit](https://github.com/gd-edit/GDE) - A third-party Geometry Dash editor.

- [Vignette](https://github.com/vignette-project/vignette) - An OpenCV-based facial recognition software for Live2D

- [IWBTM](https://github.com/EVAST9919/iwbtm) - A platform game with level editor based off of "I Wanna..." games

- [DeltaDash](https://deltada.sh/) - A multi-direction, lane-based scroller rhythm game

- [fluXis](https://github.com/TeamFluXis/fluXis) - A community-driven rhythm game with a focus on creativity and expression

This wiki will give you a rough guide on giving you a head start on making your first project in osu!framework!
